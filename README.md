# Sign Up Page Component

Our sign up/sign in page is a visually appealing and interactive experience for users. We have created an interactive smiley face from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, which looks at the email from left to right as the user types and puts sunglass on, when user writes password. Our page is also mobile-friendly, with a mockup mobile screen to ensure easy navigation on-the-go.

## My process
n creating our sign up/sign in page, we used a combination of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. We started by creating the smiley face from scratch, including its eyebrows, eyelashes, cornea, eyeball, sunglass, and mouth. Then, we designed the page to be mobile-friendly and optimized for a seamless sign up/sign in process.
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned
Through this project, we learned how to create an interactive smiley face using JavaScript and how to design a mobile-friendly page with a mockup mobile screen. We also gained a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

In the future, we plan to continue developing our sign up/sign in page by adding additional features, such as password strength indicators or social media sign-up options.
